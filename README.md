# About Me
I am a senior architect and developer with many, many years of experience in software development, design and architecture.
I have coded in many languages including basic, fortran, pascal, delphi, java, C++, C# as well as Asp.Net, PhP and HTML.
Over the last 7 years my main language of choice has been c#, specifically the dot net standard framework.
Having used gitHub MIT software many times, its time for me to start to contribute to the community and hope to do so through this account.
